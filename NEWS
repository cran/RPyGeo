RPyGeo 1.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:

 * The R-ArcMap interface was completely rewritten, and is now based on the **reticulate** package. The reticulate package accesses the arcpy Python side-package and provides all arcpy functions and classes in the R session.

New features:

 * `rpygeo_load()` - Load the output of arcpy functions into the R session
 * `rpygeo_save()` - Save temporary files to the workspace
 * `rpygeo_search()` - Searches for arcpy functions
 * `rpygeo_help()` - View arcpy help files in RStudio viewer panel or browser
 * Map algebra operators
 * File geodatabase support
 * Code compilation in RStudio
 * Forward arcpy function output with the `%>%` operator
